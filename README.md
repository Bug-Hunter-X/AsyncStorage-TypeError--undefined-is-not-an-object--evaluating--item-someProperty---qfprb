# React Native AsyncStorage TypeError Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native: a TypeError when accessing properties of an undefined object retrieved from AsyncStorage.  The bug arises when attempting to access properties of data retrieved from AsyncStorage before checking if the data exists.

## Bug Description
When retrieving data from AsyncStorage using `getItem`, if the key doesn't exist or the value is null, the returned value will be null. Attempting to access properties of this null value results in a `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'item.someProperty')`.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a check to ensure that the retrieved data is not null before attempting to access its properties.  This is crucial for handling situations where the key may not exist or the value is empty.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an emulator or device.
4. Observe the error when attempting to access data from AsyncStorage before checking for null values.
5. Review the solution provided for the appropriate fix.
